It is based on the idea that genetic variants, which are inherited randomly and not influenced by environmental factors or reverse causation, can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome.\nThese resources aim to provide a starting point for understanding the basic concepts and methods of MR, as well as the current best practices and software tools available for conducting MR studies."

However, the historical lack of standards for data content and file formats in GWAS summary statistics has resulted in heterogeneous data sets. To address this issue, standardizing and harmonizing the GWAS summary statistics is crucial before conducting MR analyses. The GWAS Catalog and OpenGWAS platforms have developed formats such as GWAS-SSF (Hayhurst et al. 2022) and GWAS-VCF (Lyon et al. 2021) to facilitate sharing of GWAS SumStats.

Setting clump_p1 = 1 and clump_p2 = 1 will perform clumping on all available SNPs. The GWAS summary statistics used in this analysis are from a population of European ancestry, and therefore the EUR reference panel is specified.\n\n\nLD clump exposure\n# Perform LD clumping on SNP data, filter SNPs to make it run faster\nexposure_clump <- exposure %>% \n  filter(pval.exposure < 0.01) %>%\n  clump_data(.,\n  clump_kb = 10000,\n  clump_r2 = 0.001,\n  clump_p1 = 1,\n  clump_p2 = 1,\n  pop = \"EUR\"\n)\n\n# Should filter here at GWS, I dont here to demonstrate proxy snps\n# exposure_dat <- filter(exposure_clump, pval.exposure < 5e-8)\nexposure_dat <- exposure_clump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTypically, in a Two-Sample MR analysis, one would only consider genome-wide significant SNPs (SNPs with pval.exposure < 5e-8).

In some cases, variants in the exposure dataset may not be present in the outcome dataset due to different GWAS using different genotyping arrays, impuation methods, and QC practices. To overcome this, proxy variants in the outcome dataset can be substituted for the missing variant.\nHere we first extract our exposure SNPs from the outcome GWAS and determine which SNPs are not presenting in the outcome dataset. We then query the LDLink web server to identify proxy variants that are in strong LD (r2) with the missing variant. The resulting proxy SNPs are then extracted from the outcome dataset and appended to the initial SNPs extracted from the outcome GWAS using munge_proxies() function.\n\n\nIdentify Proxy Variants\n# extract exposure SNPs present in outcome\noutcome_clump <- semi_join(\n  outcome, exposure_dat, by = \"SNP\"\n)\n\n# Exposure SNPs not present in outomce\nexp_snps_wo <- anti_join(\n  exposure_dat, outcome, by = \"SNP\"\n)\n\n# Use LDLinkR to identify proxy snps\nLDproxy_batch(exp_snps_wo$SNP, \n        pop = \"CEU\",             # Match population ancestries\n        r2d = \"r2\", \n        token = 'a6deee62cc4a', \n        append = TRUE,           # We appended the results of each LDlink query to a single file\n        genome_build = \"grch37\") # Select genome build based on summary stats\nsystem(\"mv combined_query_snp_list_grch37.txt data/exposure_outcome_proxy_snps.txt\")\n\n\n# Munge proxy snp file\noutcome_dat <- munge_proxies(\"data/exposure_outcome_proxy_snps.txt\", outcome, outcome_clump)"

Int J Epidemiol 46, dyx034 (2017).\n\nIVW: The simplest method for MR causal effect estimation is the inverse variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis of each genetic instrument’s Wald ratio. This is similar to conducting a weighted regression of SNP-exposure effects against SNP-outcome effects, with the regression line passing through the origin. Fixed effects IVW is the most powerful method for MR analysis and is widely accepted as the primary method. However, it assumes that there is no horizontal pleiotropy and is sensitive to violations of MR assumptions. Random effects IVW relaxes this assumption by allowing each SNP to have a different mean effect, providing an unbiased estimate if horizontal pleiotropy is present in a balanced manner.\nMaximum likelihood: The causal effect is estimated by direct maximization of the liklihood given the SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome effects and assuming a linear relationship between the exposure and outcome. May provide more reliable results in the presence of measurement error in the SNP-exposure effects, but assumes that there is no heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy.\nMR-Egger: The Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method can be modified to account for horizontal pleiotropy by including a non-zero intercept. This allows for an estimation of net horizontal pleiotropic effects even if they are not balanced or directional. However, this approach assumes that the horizontal pleiotropic effects are uncorrelated with the SNP-exposure effects, known as the InSIDE assumption. Despite this, the MR-Egger method may have lower precision, leading to a reduction in statistical power to detect causal relationships.\nMode Based Estimators: Clusters SNPs into groups based on similarity of their causal effects and returns the causal estimates based on the cluster with the largest number of SNPs. Weighting each SNPs contribution to the clustering by the inverse variance of its outcome of its outcome effect can be also be used. Returns an unbiased causal estimate when all the SNPs in the largest cluster are valid instruments.\nMedian Based Estimators: Estimating the causal effect by taking the median effect of all avaliable SNPs allows for only half the SNPs needing to be valid instruments. Weighting the contribution of each SNP by the inverse variance of its association with the outcome allows for stronger SNPs to contribute more towards the estimate."

Directional horizontal pleiotropy refers to the situation where a genetic variant used as an instrumental variable in a Mendelian randomization (MR) study influences the exposure and outcome in the same direction. This can result in biased estimates of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome, and compromise the validity of the MR results.\nWe observe that the MR-Egger regression intercept for Total cholesterol onto AD is significant, suggesting that the IVW causal estimate is biased by directional horizontal pleiotropy.\n\n\nPleiotropy\nres_pleio <- mr_pleiotropy_test(mr_dat)\n\nres_pleio %>%\n  select(-id.exposure, -id.outcome, -outcome, -exposure) %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c('egger_intercept', 'se')\n  ) %>%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = pval,\n    rows = pval > 0.001,\n    decimals = 3\n  ) %>% \n  fmt_scientific(\n    columns = pval,\n    rows = pval <= 0.001,\n    decimals = 1\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      egger_intercept\n      se\n      pval\n    \n  \n  \n    −0.02\n0.01\n0.023\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeterogeneity\nHeterogeneity refers to the variability or diversity in the relationship between an exposure variable and an outcome variable across different genetic variants that are used as instrumental variables. Heterogeneity can arise due to several factors, including differences in the strength of the genetic associations with the exposure and outcome, differences in the direction of effect, or differences in the way that the genetic variants interact with other variables that may confound the relationship. Heterogeneity can pose a challenge for the validity of the MR results, as it may indicate that the assumption of a consistent relationship between the exposure and outcome across different SNPs is not met. If heterogeneity is present, it can indicate that the underlying causal relationship between the exposure and outcome is complex and cannot be captured by a single SNP or set of SNPs.\nWe can estimate heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q Test. We observe that there is significant heterogeneity in the IVW and MR-Egger analysis, further highlighting that the IVW causal estimates are likely biased.\n\n\nHeterogeneity\n# Heterogeneity statistics \nres_het <- mr_heterogeneity(mr_dat, method_list = c(\"mr_egger_regression\", \"mr_ivw\"))\n\nres_het %>%\n  select(-id.exposure, -id.outcome, -outcome, -exposure) %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = Q\n  ) %>%\n  fmt_number(\n    columns = Q_pval,\n    rows = Q_pval > 0.001,\n    decimals = 3\n  ) %>% \n  fmt_scientific(\n    columns = Q_pval,\n    rows = Q_pval <= 0.001,\n    decimals = 1\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      method\n      Q\n      Q_df\n      Q_pval\n    \n  \n  \n    MR Egger\n862.04\n82\n2.1 × 10−130\n    Inverse variance weighted\n918.33\n83\n5.2 × 10−141\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFunnel plots in which the estimate for each SNP is plotted against its precision can be used to visually inspect for horizontal pleitropy, with asymmetry indicative of invalid instruments.\n\n\nFunnel plots\nfunnel_p <- mr_funnel_plot(res_single)\nfunnel_out_p <- funnel_p[[1]] + theme_bw() + \n  guides(color=guide_legend(ncol =1)) + \n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 8), \n  )\n\nfunnel_out_p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutliers\nLeave-one-out analysis can be used to determine if a MR causal estimate is driven or biased by a single SNP that might have a particularly large horizontal pleiotropic effect.

However, the majority of our sensitivity analysis are non-significant suggesting that our IVW estimated is biased. Furthermore, while the MR-Egger causal estimate is significant, this is likely due to violations of the InSIDE assumption. The robustness of our causal estimate is further called into question by the presense of significant heterogeneity, horizontal pleitropy, and outliers."

This step is performed to reduce the risk of spurious results arising due to multi-collinearity by including correlated SNPs. LD clumping identifies lead SNPs in each locus and discards the remaining SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium with them.\n\n\nClump Combined Exposures\n## Do another round of LD clumping \nclump_comb_exp <- comb_exp_wide %>% \n  clump_data(.,\n  clump_kb = 10000,\n  clump_r2 = 0.001,\n  clump_p1 = 1,\n  clump_p2 = 1,\n  pop = \"EUR\"\n)\n\ncomb_exp_independent <- comb_exp %>% filter(SNP %in% clump_comb_exp$SNP) \n\n\nDue to the high correlation among genetic variants, the GWAS of HDL and LDL may identify loci in the same genomic region. After LD clumping on the smallest p-value from the exposures, we retained 136 of the initial 164 SNPs, ensuring that we included only independent variants in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      LDL < 5e-08\n      HDL < 5e-08\n      n\n    \n  \n  \n    FALSE\nTRUE\n66\n    TRUE\nFALSE\n57\n    TRUE\nTRUE\n13\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\nExtract exposures SNPs from the outcome GWAS.

    "text": "Summary\nMultivariable MR allows estimation of causal relationships between multiple exposures and a single outcome. In univariable MR, we observed that HDL cholesterol levels are associated with a reduced risk of AD, while LDL cholesterol is associated with an increased risk. However, both exposures are highly correlated, and it is difficult to estimate the independent effects of HDL and LDL cholesterol on AD. Using MVMR, we found that after adjusting for the effects of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol was no longer independently associated with AD. This suggests that the observed association between HDL cholesterol and AD risk in univariable MR analyses may be driven by the shared effects of LDL cholesterol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Outcome\n      method\n      \n        LDL\n      \n      \n        HDL\n      \n    \n    \n      b\n      se\n      p\n      b\n      se\n      p\n    \n  \n  \n    AD\nMRMV-IVW\n0.27\n0.08\n8.7 × 10−4\n−0.12\n0.09\n0.201\n    AD\nMRMV-Egger\n0.43\n0.10\n9.8 × 10−6\n−0.12\n0.09\n0.174\n    AD\nMRMV-WME\n0.04\n0.06\n0.544\n0.01\n0.06\n0.911\n    AD\nMRMV_WBE\n−0.07\nNA\n0.151\n−0.03\nNA\n0.495"
