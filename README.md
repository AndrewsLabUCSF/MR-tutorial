# Mendelian randomization tutorial

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method used to infer causality between and exposure and outcome using genetic variants as instrumental variables. It is based on the idea that genetic variants, which are inherited randomly and not influenced by environmental factors or reverse causation, can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. 

These resources aim to provide a starting point for understanding the basic concepts and methods of MR, as well as the current best practices and software tools available for conducting MR studies. 

See the [tutorial](https://andrewslabucsf.github.io/MR-tutorial/) for additional information on the phenotypes of interest, the methods used, and a suggested reading list.
